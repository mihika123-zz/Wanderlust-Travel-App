# Wanderlust

Wanderlust is a centralized application which enables users to search various cities and decide which places they would like to visit while at their destination. It makes use of various advanced search options to help users fully utilise the database. It also enables businesses to add new places to visit. Users can also create a custom itinerary by favoriting places. We will eventually allow users to collaborate with friends and purchase tickets, etc. on this platform itself.
